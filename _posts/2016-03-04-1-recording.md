First of all, whatever your age or orientation, go see Pixar's new movie, _Inside Out_. If you need more reason than "it's Pixar," try this: it's a sophisticated, hilarious, brilliant, warm, beautiful, and perfectly paced film that --- finally --- stars a girl who is not a princess. 

While nominally about the emotions in a young girl's head, the movie is also fundamentally about memories --- how they stay with us, how they influence us, and how our feelings about them change. 

One of my favorite scenes was one in which we learn that memories   sometimes have to be cleared out for others to survive. I won't say more about it, so as not to spoil a truly beautiful sequence, but it helped me remind me of a fundamental truth about our lives: not every memory has equal value. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/717ceb49-c50d-4b43-af20-e3919a4c98d8.png)

This might seem self-evident, but you wouldn't know it by looking at all the ways we track our lives. All of our apps and social networks aren't really built to support a life of change and variance. It's worth considering, then, how these digital tools might be taking something away from us --- and how the very act of remembering, left in our own hands, might bring unexpected rewards.

# 1: Recording 

We record everything. What we ate last night, whom we saw, where we went. Between the accounts you have on, say, OpenTable, Uber, Instagram, and Fandango, you could probably replicate a huge portion of your life to an astonishing degree of accuracy. And that's not even relying on your credit card statements or the search history on your Google Maps. 

We're not the first to do so. One of the 20th century's great conceptual artists, On Kawara, made a career of measuring and recording his life. In his date paintings, for instance, he painted the date of whatever day he worked on the canvas, each painting no more or less than a marker of the day that he painted it. (He did this for more than 3,000 days.) 

His piece _I Got Up_ encompasses about 1,500 postcards that he mailed to friends over several years, with nothing on the card except the words "I got up" and the time that he arose. He also has maps recording his walking paths, and lists of people he met. 

Until the last few years, there was probably no human in history whose life had been so meticulously recorded. Which is amazing. But after two hours at the recent Guggenheim retrospective, absorbing thousands of details about On Kawara's life, I still had no idea who he was. 

I tend to think that scale absolves art --- meaning that we don't usually judge incredibly large or incredibly small works solely on their merits; their size requires a different (and usually more forgiving) rubric. In the case of On Kawara's work, the scale is the art. There's nothing there except the vast scope of his efforts. In these pages and postcards, we see the structure of his life, but it's strangely vacant. We can piece together the movement, but can't see the thing that moves. 

Unlike On Kawara, you and I can record things about our lives easily. We do much of it by "sharing" --- our most unexamined and most celebrated modern virtue---and the remainder is done automatically: even if we don't write "went to work" on a sheet of paper, we can tell quite easily that we were there by looking in our email archives or our calendar. 

More impactful, I think, is how present our recordings are. So much of our past is kept in front of our eyes by apps and sites that use the paradigm of a stream or timeline. They are built to facilitate a backwards glance as easily as a forward step. 

This is not inherently bad: a sense of longitudinal consistency can boost fitness or help us kick a bad habit, and all of us have, at some point, found the warmth that comes from stumbling on a years-old post and remembering a good moment. (The popularity of apps like TimeHop seem evidence enough of our love for this "accidental" discovery.) 

Just like On Kawara's life work, though, I think these data outline our lives without describing us. These discrete memories, however well recorded, don't tell us anything about ourselves.
Maybe that's because they aren't actually memories --- they're reminders.
